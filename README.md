[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://beta.webcomponents.org/element/zacharytamas/favicon-badge)

An element for declaratively updating the favicon for your webapp with dynamically-set numbers. Powered by [Favico.js](https://github.com/ejci/favico.js).


## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Developing

If you wish to work on `favicon-badge` in isolation, I recommend that you use
the [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polymer-cli

And you can run it via:

    polymer

To develop, you can use the CLI's built-in server:

    polymer serve

Once running, you can preview your work at
`http://localhost:8080/components/favicon-badge/`, where `favicon-badge` is the name of the directory containing it.


## Testing

To run the tests you again use Polymer CLI:

    polymer test
